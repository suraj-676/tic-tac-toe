Project description->
Noughts and Crosses.


[Check out the live version](https://suraj-676.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
This was my first project in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, completed during Week 3 of the 12-week course. It took me four days to write.
🎯 [project Brief](https://gist.github.com/textchimp/afcb3ddc676dccd59ccb18cb9391c87a)
We had to create our own Tic Tac Toe game. I called it "Noughts and Crosses" to unAmericanise it.
🛠 How I approached the task
Having readable code is very important to me. so i tried my best to write lots of comments while making this game.


🪲 Bugs
After winning of x or o people can still click in boxes.
the content i saw on google are much better than mine.
🙏 in Future
i will try make a better version of Tic Tac Toe with multiplayer mode and computer player mode.

🍻 Thanks
